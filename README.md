# Socket-Programming
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket listen on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server. While running the client code we provide the IP address of the server which we obtain by using the “ifconfig“ in the terminal. This project helps you transfer files from one computer to many other computers. There are many applications of socket programming you can create a chat application for the communication between the clients and server and the file transfer application and many other.
